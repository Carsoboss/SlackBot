[2024-05-20T22:12:29.900] [INFO] slackbot - User (Carson Karren): can I use the word blockchain?
[2024-05-20T22:12:34.384] [INFO] slackbot - Bot: Yes, you can use the word 'blockchain'. It is a term used to describe the decentralized, digital ledger where transactions made in digital rewards or cryptocurrencies are recorded chronologically and publicly. However, remember to present it in a compliance-approved manner. For instance, emphasize its role in verifying and securing transactions, facilitating network operations and distributing rewards for participation, instead of tying it to potential investment returns or speculative value.
[2024-05-20T22:13:28.258] [INFO] slackbot - User (Carson Karren): what about ecosystem?
[2024-05-20T22:13:41.215] [INFO] slackbot - Bot: The term 'ecosystem' requires careful use in compliance-regulated discussions. Solely using 'ecosystem' can be unclear and can imply a centralized or company-controlled environment. Instead, it's recommended to use terms like 'community-driven ecosystem' or 'decentralized ecosystem' to emphasize the distributed, open, and collaborative nature of blockchain networks. 

For example, instead of saying, "Our ecosystem allows you to earn tokens," you could frame it like, "The community-driven ecosystem rewards participants with digital rewards for their active participation and contribution." 

Remember, maintaining clarity about the decentralized nature of the blockchain and the utility-based, non-investment role of digital rewards is crucial.

[2024-05-20T22:14:40.554] [INFO] slackbot - User (Carson Karren): what about the word token?
[2024-05-20T22:14:45.969] [INFO] slackbot - Bot: While the use of 'token' is not outright banned, it's recommended to use the term 'digital rewards' instead. This term better illustrates what users receive for their participation and contributions in the blockchain network. Using the term 'token' may convey implications of financial or speculative value, which is contrary to our compliance guidelines. Remember, we want to emphasize their utility-based, non-investment nature.
